# Contributing to NoElSuite

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

NoElSuite is experimental, deliberate, and opinionated.
Contributions are welcome if they align with the intent of the language.

---

## Philosophy First

NoEl values:
- clarity over cleverness
- semantic meaning over generality
- explicit behavior over magic
- constraints as design tools

If a contribution weakens these goals, it likely does not belong.

---

## Good Contributions

Good contributions tend to:
- improve correctness
- clarify semantics
- reduce ambiguity
- improve documentation
- simplify existing behavior

Examples:
- better error handling
- clearer grammar
- renderer correctness fixes
- documentation improvements

---

## Likely Out of Scope

- general-purpose language features
- loops or mutation
- hidden or implicit behavior
- features added “because other languages have them”

---

## Code Expectations

- prioritize readability
- prefer explicit names
- avoid magic numbers
- document why decisions exist

---

## Proposing Changes

For grammar or semantic changes:
1. open an issue
2. explain the problem
3. explain why existing constructs are insufficient
4. explain how the change aligns with NoEl’s goals

---

## Experimental Nature

Breaking changes are expected.
Refactors are normal.
Iteration is intentional.

---

## Conduct

- be respectful
- be precise
- disagree with ideas, not people

---
